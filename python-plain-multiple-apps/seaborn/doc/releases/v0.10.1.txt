v0.10.1 (Unreleased)
--------------------

This is minor release with bug fixes issues in 0.10.0.

- Fixed a bug that appeared within the bootstrapping algorithm on 32-bit systems.

- Fixed a bug where :func:`regplot` would crash on singleton inputs. Now a crash is avoided and regression estimation/plotting is skipped.

- Fixed a bug where :func:`heatmap` would ignore user-specified under/over/bad values when recentering a colormap.

- Fixed a bug where :func:`heatmap` would use values from masked cells when computing default colormap limits.

- Fixed a bug where :func:`despine` would cause an error when trying to trim spines on a matplotlib categorical axis.

- Adapted to a change in matplotlib that caused problems with single swarm plots.

- Added the ``showfliers`` parameter to :func:`boxenplot` to suppress plotting of outlier data points, matching the API of :func:`boxplot`.
